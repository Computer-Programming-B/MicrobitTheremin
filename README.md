# Make a Theremin like musical instrument
![](Theremin.jpg)   
In this lab we will make a musical instrument that is controlled with the micro:bit light sensor. The light sensor will respond to the shadow of our hand, so we won't need to actually touch it to make it respond. This will create an instrument similar to a [Theremin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theremin), an electronic musical instrument that is played without touching it.

### Suggested steps to starting the project
TBD

### Extensions
Feel free to modify your theremin circuit or code in any way you wish. Have fun and be creative, your theremin doesn't have to work or sound like any other
